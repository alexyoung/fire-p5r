h2. Fire in Ruby Processing

This code draws fire with a simple algorithm in "Ruby Processing":http://wiki.github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing

Here's a video: "Fire video":http://screencast.com/t/69TnHrKqG4

h3. Algorithm:

1. Create an indexed palette of red, orange and yellows

2. Loop over the following:

* Draw a random set of colours from the palette at the bottom of the screen
* Loop through each pixel and average the colour index value around it
* Reduce the average by a fire intensity factor
